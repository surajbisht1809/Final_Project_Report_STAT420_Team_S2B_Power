Life Expectancy Factors and Prediction

Source of dataset
Our study will focus on various factors affecting life expectancy considering demographic variables, income composition and mortality rates. Life expectancy dataset made available to public for the purpose of health data analysis. This dataset is related to life expectancy, health factors from year 2000-2015 for 193 countries has been collected from comes Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health Organization. The dataset contains 2938 records and 22 columns. For our project dataset is sourced from Kaggle: Kaggle Dataset Source Link

Statement of personal interest
Research: Our team like to apply the knowledge gained in STAT420 course to understand how data analysis techniques and linear regression model can guide us to build best possible model and predict within a reasonable amount of confidence the life expectancy of different countries around the world. This will eventually help government officials adopt the necessary steps to help increase the life expectancy.

Inspiration and Personal interest: We would like to explore how statistics combined with technology can make difference in real-world use cases impacting every individual, provides guidelines to government policies and encourage them take informed decisions in time. We are planning to use different predictors like BMI, alcohol intake, HIV/aids and many more. Our aim is through statistics to help determining the predicting factors that are contributing to lower value of life expectancy. Explainable model clearly identify predictors contributing to life expectancy and by improving certain predictors (for example improving the polio vaccine intake or reducing alcohol) life expectancy can be improved.
